ARCameraHeadRom
===============

Firmware for computer controlled stepper motor based stereoscopic camera head with pan and tilt functionality. For PC drivers used to cotrol the head see [ARCameraHeadAPI](https://github.com/mrozo/ARCameraHeadAPI) and for the documentation check [ARCameraHeadThesis](https://github.com/mrozo/ARCameraHeadThesis).

The firmware was developed for ATMega8 and is intended to be used together with ARCameraHeadAPI that is a PC software developed to control the device over USB. This code is a parto of university thesis "Stereoscopic camera system with pan and tilt functionality controled in real time by oculus rift". The project has been created together with JÄ™drzej D. and Maciej R. . I (mrozo) was responsible for creating the mechanics, electronics, firmware for the elctronics and drivers exposing API used to control the camera head.

The code

The firmware is a kind of real time scheduler with a custom stepper motor controller and uart based communication protocol with framing and feedback.
